# Factorial
Prompt the user to type in a number. Then display the factorial of that number.

Hints: 
- Again, the built-in Console object is your friend. Use Intellisense to see if there’s a method on the Console object that will accept a value from the user (from the command line).
- There’s a few ways to calculate the factorial – I’ll let you choose an appropriate one. 
- If the user types in a letter instead of a number, your factorial calculation will obviously fail. 
- Take a look at the Int32.Parse and/or Int32.TryParse methods to make sure the user enters an integer.
